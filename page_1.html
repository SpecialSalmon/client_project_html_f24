<h2>I’m short on food, but I don’t think I need ‘help’.</h2>
<p>    Come on in anyway. Just look around or leave with a couple grocery bags, it’s your choice. We’re here to support you, however you need it. Choose a time that best suits you through our online appointment system.</p>
<h2>  Will this impact my financial aid?</h2>
<p>    No, accessing Maize and Blue Cupboard will not impact your financial aid.
</p>
<h2>Is there a limit on food?</h2>
<p>There’s no limit on food. Take what you need, but eat what you take. We’re set up like a grocery store, so you have free choice to choose what you prefer to eat. You might see suggested portions for certain food items. This is to help ensure we don’t run out of high-demand items. If there is something else you’d like to see in the space, let us know.</p>
